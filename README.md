# Neural-Networks

## Introduction

Neural networks are a class of machine learning models that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are used for a variety of tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many more. Neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes or neurons that are designed to process information and make predictions.

### MLPClassifier

MLPClassifier is a neural network algorithm that is used for classification tasks. It stands for Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier and is implemented in the scikit-learn library in Python. The MLPClassifier is a feedforward neural network that uses backpropagation to train the model. It is called a feedforward network because the input data is fed forward through the layers of the network until it reaches the output layer. The backpropagation algorithm is used to adjust the weights of the neurons in the network to minimize the error between the predicted and actual output.
